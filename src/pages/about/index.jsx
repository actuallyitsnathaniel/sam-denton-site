            is an indie Pop-n-B artist from Northern California. Driven by a
            passion for empathy and inclusivity, Sam combines soulful melodies
            with authentic lyrics in hopes to bring people in on a collective
            experience. With influences spanning genres and genuine realness,
            thereâ€™s something for everyone to connect to. Sam has amassed over
            400k streams on Spotify with his current collection of singles and
            EP, "for now," and has much more scheduled for release later this
            year.
